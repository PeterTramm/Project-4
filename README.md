<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<p>The goal of this project is to utizlise machine learning to create a recommendation system for movies and tv-shows for an individual. 

Hopefully We will gain access to IMBD free dataset API to use with AWS to create this model. If not we will use movielens dataset to achieve the same outcome.

### Built With

* HTML
* JavaScript
* Python
* Amazon Web Services

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

#### Part 1: Data selection & Data Cleaning
- [x] Selection of dataset ([IMBD dataset API](https://ap-southeast-2.console.aws.amazon.com/dataexchange/home?region=ap-southeast-2#/subscription-requests/ar-62ooqqu9rgpt9x235sp06f1qk) / [MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/))
- [ ] Storyboard model usage/training/prediction
- [ ] Cleaning of dataset
- [ ] Standardizing of dataset 

#### Part 2: Hosting dataset onto a cloud server
- [ ] Upload data to a cloud server (AWS)
- [ ] Pull data into where we write our ML model.

#### Part 3: Machine learning
- [ ] Create training model 
- [ ] Identify highest accurary parameters 
- [ ] Test prediction

#### Part 4: Create flask webpage 
- [ ] Host the model onto flask server
- [ ] Create training description page 
- [ ] Create use prediction page
