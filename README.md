<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

#### Part 1: Data selection & Data Cleaning
- [] Selection of dataset 
- [] Storyboard model usage/training/prediction
- [] Cleaning of dataset
- [] Standardizing of dataset 

#### Part 2: Hosting onto a cloud server
- [] Upload data to a cloud server (Neon/AWS?)
- [] Pull data into javascript/python files

#### Part 3: Machine learning
- [] Create training model 
- [] Identify highest accurary parameters 
- [] Test prediction

#### Part 4: Create flask webpage 
- [] Host the model onto flask server
- [] Create training description page 
-   [] Create use prediction page
